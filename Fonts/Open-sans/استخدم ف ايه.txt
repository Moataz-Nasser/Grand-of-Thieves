THE STORY




 Grand Of Thieves is an open-world game that we dream to make, the game will be played in 3 characters in 3 different worlds, you can say 3 games in 1, we’re focusing on the details more than the game itself, So you can interact with every NPC, all of them have a different reaction to you, You can be kind to them so they will have a loyalty to you.

Any action you take in the game will somehow affect you, as near as possible to reality, as an example if you started a fight with a random NPC, Someone in the street will call the police and you’ll send to jail.
In jail you can earn money from doing random missions, every mission will increase the loyalty of the companion NPC to you, so you call them anytime to do side quests together (something like supermarket robbery).

That's one random situation you can imagine anything to do, somehow it will affect you in the game future.
